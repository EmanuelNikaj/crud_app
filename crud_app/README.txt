Here we have an applicaion in which you can easily make a programm that allows you 
to Create,Update,Reset and Delete your inserts 
and in this one you can see that we have a student managament system.

First of all you have to make a Database name = crud_operations with a table named students that has thse options:
-id
-first_name
-last_name
-age

and in this just go ahead and take all .php files 

As for the LOGIN_SYSTEM do the same like the above but this tieme name the Database login_system with a table named users and these options:
-id
-username
-email_id

To run all of the above you have to make a file in xampp with the name crud_app 
and then again in xampp another file named login_system
